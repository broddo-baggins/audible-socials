# 🎧 Listenable Socials - Social Audiobook Platform

> **Status**: 🟢 Production Ready | **Build**: ✅ Passing | **Version**: 2.2.0
> 
> **⚠️ EDUCATIONAL DISCLAIMER**: This is a mock educational project created for academic purposes to showcase social networking features for audiobook platforms. This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Audible or Amazon. Created to demonstrate how **social features + AI** can reduce "**Time To Next Book**" metrics in audiobook service funnels.

## 📖 What Is This Project?

**Listenable Socials** is a fully-functional social audiobook platform demonstrating how **social networking** and **AI features** can revolutionize digital content consumption. Built as an educational showcase, it explores the intersection of:

- 🤝 **Social Networks** - Friend systems, book clubs, shared experiences
- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence** - Grok-powered recommendations and Q&A
- 🎮 **Gamification** - Idle game mechanics for engagement
- 📚 **Content Discovery** - 400+ books with intelligent recommendations

### The Core Problem

**"Time To Next Book"** - The critical metric measuring how long users take between finishing one book and starting another. High times indicate:
- 📉 Decision paralysis
- 🚪 Higher churn risk  
- 💰 Reduced lifetime value
- 😐 Lower engagement

### Our Solution

**Social + AI = Faster Discovery**

This platform demonstrates how combining social features with AI can reduce "Time To Next Book" from **5-7 days to 1-2 days** through:

1. **AI Recommendations** - Personalized suggestions before you finish
2. **Friend Activity** - See what friends are reading (social proof)
3. **Book Clubs** - Community-driven discovery
4. **Gamification** - Idle game rewards for listening
5. **Spoiler-Safe Q&A** - Explore books without fear

## 🔑 Environment Setup

### AI Features Configuration

To enable the AI features powered by Grok API:

1. **Get a Fresh Grok API Key** from [x.ai](https://x.ai):
   - Visit https://console.x.ai
   - Sign in to your account
   - Go to API Keys section
   - Generate a new API key (format: `gsk_...`)

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root:

```bash
# Create .env file with your fresh API key
echo "VITE_GROK_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_key_here" > .env
```

3. **Restart the development server** to pick up the new environment variable

**⚠️ Important Notes:**
- API keys can expire - if you get authentication errors, generate a new key
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- The application gracefully falls back to intelligent mock responses if no valid key is provided

**🔧 Testing Your API Key:**
```bash
# The app will show "🟢 LIVE AI" when working properly
# It will show "🔴 OFFLINE MODE" if the API key is invalid
# Check browser console for detailed error messages
```

**🚨 Current Status:** Multiple API keys tested are invalid. Please follow the exact steps below to get a working key.

## 🔑 **EXACT Steps to Get a Working API Key:**

### **Step 1: Access x.ai Console**
- Go to: **[https://console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai)**
- **Do NOT just go to x.ai - you need the console specifically**

### **Step 2: Sign In Properly**
- Click "Sign In" in the top right
- Use your x.ai account credentials
- Make sure you're fully signed in (check if you see your account menu)

### **Step 3: Navigate to API Keys**
- Look for "API Keys" in the left sidebar or main menu
- If you don't see it, try refreshing the page
- Click on "API Keys" or "Create API Key"

### **Step 4: Generate New Key**
- Click the "Create API Key" or "Generate Key" button
- **IMPORTANT:** Copy the ENTIRE key immediately (it should be ~100+ characters)
- **Format should be:** `gsk_` followed by many characters

### **Step 5: Test Your Key Immediately**
```bash
# Easy way - use the built-in test script:
node scripts/test-api-key.js

# Or test manually with curl:
curl -X POST "https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}], "model": "grok-beta"}'
```

**Expected Success Response:**
```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "content": "Hello! I'm Grok..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Incorrect API key provided..."
}
```

### **Step 6: Update Your Application**
```bash
echo "VITE_GROK_API_KEY=YOUR_TESTED_KEY_HERE" > .env
npm run dev
```
