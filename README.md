## 🔑 Environment Setup

### AI Features Configuration

To enable the AI features powered by Grok API:

1. **Get a Fresh Grok API Key** from [x.ai](https://x.ai):
   - Visit https://console.x.ai
   - Sign in to your account
   - Go to API Keys section
   - Generate a new API key (format: `gsk_...`)

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root:

```bash
# Create .env file with your fresh API key
echo "VITE_GROK_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_key_here" > .env
```

3. **Restart the development server** to pick up the new environment variable

**⚠️ Important Notes:**
- API keys can expire - if you get authentication errors, generate a new key
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- The application gracefully falls back to intelligent mock responses if no valid key is provided

**🔧 Testing Your API Key:**
```bash
# The app will show "🟢 LIVE AI" when working properly
# It will show "🔴 OFFLINE MODE" if the API key is invalid
# Check browser console for detailed error messages
```

**🚨 Current Status:** Multiple API keys tested are invalid. Please follow the exact steps below to get a working key.

## 🔑 **EXACT Steps to Get a Working API Key:**

### **Step 1: Access x.ai Console**
- Go to: **[https://console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai)**
- **Do NOT just go to x.ai - you need the console specifically**

### **Step 2: Sign In Properly**
- Click "Sign In" in the top right
- Use your x.ai account credentials
- Make sure you're fully signed in (check if you see your account menu)

### **Step 3: Navigate to API Keys**
- Look for "API Keys" in the left sidebar or main menu
- If you don't see it, try refreshing the page
- Click on "API Keys" or "Create API Key"

### **Step 4: Generate New Key**
- Click the "Create API Key" or "Generate Key" button
- **IMPORTANT:** Copy the ENTIRE key immediately (it should be ~100+ characters)
- **Format should be:** `gsk_` followed by many characters

### **Step 5: Test Your Key Immediately**
```bash
# Easy way - use the built-in test script:
node scripts/test-api-key.js

# Or test manually with curl:
curl -X POST "https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}], "model": "grok-beta"}'
```

**Expected Success Response:**
```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "content": "Hello! I'm Grok..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Incorrect API key provided..."
}
```

### **Step 6: Update Your Application**
```bash
echo "VITE_GROK_API_KEY=YOUR_TESTED_KEY_HERE" > .env
npm run dev
```

- Smooth scrolling and transitions

##  User Testing Prompts

The demo includes these key testing scenarios:

1. **Join Book Club Flow**: "What made you want/not want to join this club?"
2. **Club Page with Events**: "Would this make you want to read this book sooner?"
3. **Credit Requirement UX**: "Do you feel pressure or motivation to use a credit here?"
4. **Friend/Library Sharing**: "Would seeing a friend's list influence your next book pick?"
5. **Club Notifications**: "Are these updates useful or overwhelming?"

## 🎯 Key Innovation: AI-Powered Discovery

This project demonstrates how AI can reduce the "Time To Next Book" metric by:

1. **Proactive Recommendations**: AI suggests books before users finish their current listen
2. **Social Context**: Recommendations consider friends' activity and book club discussions
3. **Spoiler-Free Exploration**: Users can learn about books without plot spoilers
4. **Personalized Discovery**: Machine learning adapts to individual reading patterns

### Metrics Impact (Theoretical)
- **Time To Next Book**: Reduce from 5-7 days to 1-2 days
- **User Engagement**: Increase book discovery by 40%
- **Social Features**: Drive 60% more friend interactions
- **Retention**: Improve subscription renewal by 25%

##  Future Enhancements
